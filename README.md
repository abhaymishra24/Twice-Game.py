## Project Description✍️

In this project, I programmed two game in python programming language-

First Game - Snake-Water-Gun game, Here the rules of game-
- Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.
- Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water.
- Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.

According rules of this game, I wrote a python program capable of playing this game with the user. 

Second Game - Guess-Perfect-Number game, Here are the game rules -

- If the player’s guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays “Lower number please”.
- Similarly, if the user’s guess is too low, the program prints “higher number please”.
- When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.

According rules of this game, I wrote a python program capable of playing this game with the user.

## Objective✍️

1. Learn basic python programming.
2. Build such a intresting thing using python programming.
3. Build commond on python language from creating this intresting game.
4. Learn, Think, Create, Code, Fun.

## Work and Learning by- [ Abhay Mishra 🧑‍💻 ]

I try to explore new interstion things and create using python programming language.Learning new libraries and functions in Python to upskill myself. Learn how to use the Python programming language in different technologies and build real-world projects.
