## Project Description✍️

In this project, I programmed two game in python programming language-

First Game - Snake-Water-Gun game, Here the rules of game-
- Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.
- Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water.
- Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.

According rules of this game, I wrote a python program capable of playing this game with the user. 

Second Game - Guess-Perfect-Number game, Here are the game rules -

- If the player’s guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays “Lower number please”.
- Similarly, if the user’s guess is too low, the program prints “higher number please”.
- When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.

According rules of this game, I wrote a python program capable of playing this game with the user.
