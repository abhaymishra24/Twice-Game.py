# Twice Game (Based on the Python programming language)

In this project, there are two games that were created using the Python programming language - 

1. Snake-Water-Gun (Game)
2. Guess perfect number (Game)

## Project Description‚úçÔ∏è

In this project, I programmed two games in the Python programming language -

First Game - Snake-Water-Gun game, Here the rules of game-
- Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.
- Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water.
- Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.

According to the rules of this game, I wrote a Python program capable of playing this game with the user.

Second Game - Guess-Perfect-Number game, Here are the game rules -

- If the player‚Äôs guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays ‚ÄúLower number please‚Äù.
- Similarly, if the user‚Äôs guess is too low, the program prints ‚Äúhigher number please‚Äù.
- When the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.

According to the rules of this game, I wrote a Python program capable of playing this game with the user.

## Objective‚úçÔ∏è

1. Learn basic python programming.
2. Build something interesting using Python programming.
3. Build a strong command of the Python language by creating this interesting project.
4. Learn, Think, Create, Code, Fun.

## Worked and Learned by- [ Abhay Mishra üßë‚Äçüíª ]

I try to explore new interesting things and create using the Python programming language. Learning new libraries and functions in Python to upskill myself. Learn how to use the Python programming language in different technologies and build real-world projects.
